1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	dogs is created with the three Dog objects, and the compare function takes in two animals


3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	the comparator constructor call happens as the second parameter in the line Collections.sort(dogs, ....). The class definition is also inside the .sort(dogs, ...) it saves a lot space by just placing it in there.
